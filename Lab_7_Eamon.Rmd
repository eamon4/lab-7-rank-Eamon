This is a comandment from the creator: From now on, all "commits" from this document shall be called "kermits" -the creator

But are they green????? -You dare defy the creator!!!!!!!! Blasphlamy!

If you are the collaborator:
-load the tidyverse
-read the kermit data as 'kermit'
-make some side-by-side histograms of the Score.pre for all respondents, separated by the Gender column

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 4) +
  facet_wrap(~Gender)

kermit_hist

```
